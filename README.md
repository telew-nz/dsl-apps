# Telew Apps

This contains a copy of all the source code for all the Telew apps.

## Updating

The source code can be updated using [ImportAllApps] script.

## Latest

Having all versions at once makes it difficult to search and so you can use the `latest` branch to view only the latest
version of each app.

To delete all versions other than the latest run the [DeleteAllButLatest] script.

[ImportAllApps]: ./src/main/scala/ImportAllApps.scala
[DeleteAllButLatest]: ./src/main/scala/DeleteAllButLatest.scala
